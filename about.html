    <h2>About Coffee</h2>
    <p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain flowering plants
        in the Coffea species. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product:
        unroasted green coffee.</p>
    <p>The word coffee entered the English language in 1582 through the Dutch word koffie, borrowed from the Ottoman
        Turkish kahwe, borrowed, in turn, from the Arabic kahwa. The Arabic word qahwah traditionally refers to a type
        of wine, the etymology of which, according to Arab lexicographers, comes from the verb qahiya, "to deprive you
        of hunger," due to the drink's reputation as an appetite suppressant.</p>
