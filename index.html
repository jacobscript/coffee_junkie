    <h3>House Blend Coffee</h3>

    <p style="width:50%">Coffee is consumed all over the world, from growing to production and distribution. There are
        so many blends,
        brands and beans, that it can be hard to understand how each cup of coffee is different from the other. A coffee
        blend is the result of a combination of two different beans to produce different flavors and strengths. Mixtures
        are not standard in the coffee industry, making it difficult to fully understand the basic differences between
        cups.</p>

    <p style="width:50%">French Roast is the name given to the degree of roasting of the coffee beans, resulting in the
        formation of dark brown coffee beans. Roasted beans
        have a dark brown color and a glossy surface from the oil. Coffee brewed from French Roast pure beans will
        have a characteristic natural aroma of mute beans, especially any acidic notes. The taste is dominated by
        bitter-sweet shades of roast. French roasted coffee dominates coffee identified with the American West. This
        roasting profile is also common in American espresso.</p>

    <h3>Colombian Roast</h3>
    <img src="./images/coffee_gr.jpg" alt="colombian roast">
    <p style="width:50%">Colombia is famous for growing some of the best coffee beans in the world; the plants thrive
        under the shade of banana trees in the tropical climate. Because of Colombiaâ€™s high altitude, it also shapes the
        way the bean grows. The unique flavors and strong aroma make Colombian coffee a fan favorite. </p>
